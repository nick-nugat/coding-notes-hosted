- an "extension" of [[Trees]]

![[slide-abt-what-a-graph-is.png]]


## Connected graphs
- graph that has a path between every pair of distinct vertices

## Complete graph
- graph that has an edge (line) between every pair of distinct vertices

## Undirected graphs
- can be [[#Connected graphs|connected]], [[#Complete graph|complete]], or disconnected
