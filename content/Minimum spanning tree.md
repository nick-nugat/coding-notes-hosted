# [[Minimum spanning tree]]
A minimum spanning tree is a spanning tree with minimum possible weights among all possible spanning trees.
- A spanning tree has its vertices connected using the minimum possible number of edges
	- Does not have cycles
	- A graph can have more than one spanning tree

## Algorithms
- [[Prim's algorithm]]
- [[Kruksal's algorithm]]
