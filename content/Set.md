# [[Set]]
- unordered list of items
- no duplicates
	- adding an element **does nothing** if it already exists in the set
	- removing an element that's not in the set is **ignored**

## Operations
- union
- intersection
- difference

## Implementing
### Explicit (bit vector)
- each item in base type has representation in each instance of a set
	- representation either true or false (item in set or not)
- space is proportional to the cardinality of the base type
	- all bit vectors use same amount of memory regardless of how many elements there are
- algorithms use boolean operations
