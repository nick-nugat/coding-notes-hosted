# [[Sorting]]
> The process of ordering a set of items.

Algorithms are measured based on **speed, memory overhead, and the effort required to implement**. 
## Types
- [[Selection sort]]
- [[Bubble sort]]
- [[Insertion sort]]
- [[Merge sort]]
- [[Quick sort]] (typically fastest)
- [[Heap sort]]
- [[Radix sort]]
- [[Binary tree sort]]



## Speeds
The speed of a sorting algorithm is dependent on:
- num of comparisons made
- num of data swaps made
	- **shallow swaps** can save time when sorting nodes
