# [[Tree]]

> [!tldr] Definition
> Trees are a form of hierarchical way of organization.

A tree is basically a restricted [[Graph]].

```java
/** An example interface of basic methods for the ADT tree.  */
public interface TreeInterface<T>{
   public T getRootData();
   public int getHeight();
   public int getNumberOfNodes();
   public boolean isEmpty();
   public void clear();
} // end TreeInterface
```

## Tree terminology
- "roots" are at the top and they are the only node with **no parent**.
- trees can be empty
- height = num of levels
- leaf nodes - nodes without child nodes

## Traversing a tree
- each item is visited **exactly once**
- order of traversal is **NOT unique**
- uses **recursion**
- to visit all nodes
	- visit root
	- visit all nodes on **root's *left* subtree**
	- visit all nodes on **root's *right* subtree**

### Types of traversals

#### In-order
> [!warning] This is not ideal for general tree traversal!

![[binary-tree-in-order-traversal.png|350]]

#### Preorder
1. root first
2. for each node (but make sure to go back up if the left subtree):
	1. left subtree
	2. right subtree
![[binary-tree-preorder-traversal.png|350]]

#### Postorder
![[binary-tree-postorder-traversal.png|350]]

#### Level-order
![[binary-tree-level-order-traversal.png|350]]

## Binary trees
Binary trees are trees where **each node** has at most *two children*.
### Example
```java
BinaryTreeInterface<String> dTree = new BinaryTree<>();
dTree.setTree("D", null, null);

BinaryTreeInterface<String> fTree = new BinaryTree<>();
fTree.setTree("F", null, null);

BinaryTreeInterface<String> gTree = new BinaryTree<>();
gTree.setTree("G", null, null);

BinaryTreeInterface<String> hTree = new BinaryTree<>();
hTree.setTree("H", null, null);

BinaryTreeInterface<String> emptyTree = new BinaryTree<>();

// Form larger subtrees
BinaryTreeInterface<String> eTree = new BinaryTree<>();
eTree.setTree("E", fTree, gTree); // Subtree rooted at E

BinaryTreeInterface<String> bTree = new BinaryTree<>();
bTree.setTree("B", dTree, eTree); // Subtree rooted at B

BinaryTreeInterface<String> cTree = new BinaryTree<>();
cTree.setTree("C", emptyTree, hTree); // Subtree rooted at C

BinaryTreeInterface<String> aTree = new BinaryTree<>();
aTree.setTree("A", bTree, cTree); // Desired tree rooted at A

// Display root, height, number of nodes
System.out.println("Root of tree contains " + aTree.getRootData());
System.out.println("Height of tree is " + aTree.getHeight());
System.out.println("Tree has " + aTree.getNumberOfNodes() + " nodes");

// Display nodes in preorder
System.out.println("A preorder traversal visits nodes in this order:");
Iterator<String> preorder = aTree.getPreorderIterator();
while (preorder.hasNext())
   System.out.print(preorder.next() + " ");
System.out.println();
```

### Types
#### Expression trees
Trees can also represent algebraic expressions.

![[expression-trees.png|350]]
![[expression-tree-evaluation-algorithm.png|350]]

#### Decision trees
These can be used for things like a guessing game.
![[decision-trees-for-a-guessing-game.png|350]]

#### Search tree
- each node in a binary search tree:
	- node's data is **greater than** all data in node's left subtree
	- node's data is **less than** all data in node's right subtree
- every node is **the root** of a binary search tree
##### Efficiency of search
- Searching a binary search tree is $O(h)$, where $h$ is height.
	- The operations add, remove, and getEntry are O(h)
- If tree of $n$ nodes has height $h = n$, these operations are $O(n)$
- Increase efficiency by making sure tree is as short as possible.

- Shortest tree is full
	- Results in these operations being $O(\log n)$

### Traversing
#### Using a Stack ([[#Preorder]] and [[#Postorder]])
![[traversing-binary-tree-using-stack.png|350]]

#### Using a Queue ([[#Level-order]])
![[traversing-binary-tree-with-queue.png|350]]


### Relation to binary search
If you print out a binary search tree using an [[#In-order]] traversal, the values will be **sorted**.
